FoodWasteSensor is a machine learning project aimed at predicting and reducing food wastage at events. Using features like guest count, food type, and event type, it forecasts expected food waste and provides actionable recommendations.

The project includes:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Regression and classification models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, R², and accuracy metrics

A user input module for real-time predictions

Visualizations for insights and model performance

🔧 Built with Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
📍 Developed on Google Colab
